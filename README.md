# ALPHACONNECT5
Neural Network Project for Connect5
I just want to have all my attempts saved, feel free to look through them, but the main codes (the final version) are

    1. FinalVersion.py for trainning the network (submit through Compute Canada).
    2. T100.pth for the stored parameters of the network.
    3. Vitulization.ipynb for the vitulization (now is trying with previous saved parameters from T.pth).
